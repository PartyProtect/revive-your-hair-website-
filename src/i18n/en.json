    "faqTitle": "Questions You Might Have",
    "faq1Question": "What if I can't afford all these treatments?",
    "faq1Answer": "The basic protocol costs as little as €30 per month, which consists of minoxidil and microneedling using a dermaroller (a cheaper device which needs regular replacement). Our most expensive protocol sets you back €50 per month. These prices exclude one-time starting costs. We offer budget-conscious options in our quiz that still target multiple mechanisms. You don't need to do everything at once—we'll help you prioritize based on what matters most for your situation.",
    "faq2Question": "How do I know this will work for ME specifically?",
    "faq2Answer": "That's what our personalized quiz is for. Your hair type, loss pattern, budget, and concerns are unique. The quiz creates a protocol tailored to your specific situation. Clinical studies show 82-95% of people see improvement with proper combination therapy—and those numbers are from dual therapy studies. The full protocols we recommend (targeting all four mechanisms simultaneously) could potentially have even higher success rates. We can't predict individual results until you try consistently for 6 months.",
    "faq3Question": "What if I'm too far gone? My hair loss is pretty advanced.",
    "faq3Answer": "The earlier you start, the better. Current research suggests that areas with no growth for 2-3+ years have lower response rates—but here's what's interesting: communities like r/tressless (where people document their results with no financial incentive) show surprising regrowth even in areas science would consider \"dead.\" The research might be incomplete here. Thinning areas almost always respond well. Completely bald areas are less predictable, but many people see results anyway. The guide helps you assess your specific situation.",
    "faq4Question": "Do I have to use these treatments forever?",
    "faq4Answer": "Yes. Hair loss is a chronic condition. If you stop treatment, you'll lose what you gained within 3-6 months and continue losing hair. Think of it like brushing your teeth—it's ongoing maintenance, not a cure. The good news: once you establish a routine, most people find it becomes second nature."
