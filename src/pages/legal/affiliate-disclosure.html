    <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 15, 2025</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>⚠️ Transparency Notice:</strong> Revive Your Hair participates in affiliate marketing programs. Some links on this website are affiliate links, meaning we may earn a commission if you make a purchase through these links at no additional cost to you.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
    <p>Affiliate links are special tracking URLs that allow companies to identify when a sale came from our website. When you click an affiliate link and make a purchase:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The merchant (seller) tracks that you came from our website</li>
      <li>If you complete a purchase, we receive a small commission</li>
      <li><strong>You pay the same price</strong> — affiliate commissions do not increase your cost</li>
      <li>The merchant pays us, not you</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Why We Use Affiliate Links</h2>
    <p>Affiliate commissions help us:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cover website hosting and maintenance costs</li>
      <li>Fund research and content creation time</li>
      <li>Keep the website free for visitors</li>
      <li>Continue providing evidence-based hair loss information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Without affiliate income, we would need to charge for access to content or rely on intrusive advertising.</p>

    <h2>3. Our Affiliate Relationships</h2>
    <p>We may participate in affiliate programs with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Telemedicine services:</strong> Hims, Keeps, Ro, Manual, and similar platforms</li>
      <li><strong>Online pharmacies:</strong> Vendors selling finasteride, minoxidil, and related products</li>
      <li><strong>E-commerce platforms:</strong> Amazon Associates and similar programs</li>
      <li><strong>Equipment vendors:</strong> Dermarollers, dermapens, and microneedling devices</li>
      <li><strong>Supplement companies:</strong> Hair loss supplements and vitamins (if recommended)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Our Commitment to Transparency</h2>
    
    <h3>4.1 Clear Disclosure</h3>
    <p>We clearly disclose affiliate relationships:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This dedicated Affiliate Disclosure page</li>
      <li>Disclosure notices on pages containing affiliate links</li>
      <li>Clear labeling of affiliate links where appropriate</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.2 Honest Recommendations</h3>
    <p><strong>We only recommend products and services we genuinely believe in:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Recommendations are based on clinical evidence, not commission rates</li>
      <li>We research products thoroughly before recommending them</li>
      <li>We would recommend these products even without affiliate commissions</li>
      <li>We do not promote products solely because they offer high commissions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.3 Editorial Independence</h3>
    <p>Our content decisions are independent:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Affiliate relationships do not influence our editorial content</li>
      <li>We maintain objectivity in product reviews and comparisons</li>
      <li>We discuss both benefits and drawbacks of products</li>
      <li>We highlight cheaper alternatives when they exist</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Products We Recommend</h2>
    
    <h3>5.1 Evidence-Based Criteria</h3>
    <p>We only recommend products that meet strict criteria:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clinical evidence:</strong> Backed by peer-reviewed research</li>
      <li><strong>Safety:</strong> FDA-approved or well-established safety profile</li>
      <li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Demonstrated results in clinical trials</li>
      <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Reputable manufacturers and suppliers</li>
      <li><strong>Value:</strong> Reasonable pricing relative to alternatives</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.2 What We Don't Recommend</h3>
    <p>We will NOT recommend products that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lack clinical evidence</li>
      <li>Make unrealistic or false claims</li>
      <li>Are overpriced compared to equivalent alternatives</li>
      <li>Have poor safety profiles or serious side effects not disclosed</li>
      <li>Come from disreputable or unlicensed sellers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. No Additional Cost to You</h2>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Using our affiliate links costs you nothing extra:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Prices are the same whether you use our link or go directly to the merchant</li>
      <li>Some merchants offer exclusive discounts through affiliate links (you may actually save money)</li>
      <li>You are never charged more because you used our link</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. You Are Never Obligated</h2>
    <p>Using affiliate links is optional:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can search for products directly instead of using our links</li>
      <li>You can shop elsewhere if you find better prices</li>
      <li>We provide product names so you can compare prices</li>
      <li>We often mention multiple purchasing options, including non-affiliate sources</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Types of Affiliate Compensation</h2>
    
    <h3>8.1 Commission-Based</h3>
    <p>Most common: We earn a percentage of the sale when you purchase through our link.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you buy a $30 dermaroller through our Amazon affiliate link, we might earn $1-2 (3-7% commission).</p>

    <h3>8.2 Pay-Per-Lead</h3>
    <p>Some programs pay for qualified leads (e.g., completing a telemedicine consultation), even if you don't make a purchase.</p>

    <h3>8.3 Flat-Fee Referrals</h3>
    <p>Some merchants pay a fixed amount per referral regardless of purchase amount.</p>

    <h2>9. No Influence on Medical Advice</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Affiliate relationships do NOT influence our medical information or treatment recommendations</li>
