---

#### 2. **public/sitemap.xml** - Search Engine Roadmap

**Why it matters**: Helps search engines discover and prioritize your content. Pages with higher priority get crawled more often.

- Page views

**Manual Tracking Functions** (use in your code):
- `trackQuizCompletion(score, recommendations)` - Track quiz results

```javascript
// Example: Track when someone completes the quiz
Analytics.trackQuizCompletion(85, 'finasteride + minoxidil');
