# üîç MYSTERY SOLVED: Timeline Analysis of the 404 Issue

## üìÖ **What You're Actually Experiencing**

You're right to be confused! Here's what's REALLY happening:

### **THE TRUTH:**
- ‚úÖ **Netlify subdomain (`reviveyourhair.netlify.app`)**: Works perfectly
- ‚ùå **Custom domain (`www.reviveyourhair.eu`)**: Returns 404 for ALL pages
- ‚ùå **Apex domain (`reviveyourhair.eu`)**: Returns 403 Forbidden

**IT'S NOT JUST THE BLOG - EVERY SINGLE PAGE IS BROKEN ON THE CUSTOM DOMAIN.**

---

## üïµÔ∏è **Why It Seems Like "Only the Blog" Is Broken**

You've been testing primarily the blog page because that's what you were focused on. But when I tested:

| URL | Result |
|-----|--------|
| `www.reviveyourhair.eu/` | ‚ùå 403 Forbidden |
| `www.reviveyourhair.eu/about` | ‚ùå 404 |
| `www.reviveyourhair.eu/store` | ‚ùå 404 |
| `www.reviveyourhair.eu/quiz` | ‚ùå 404 |
| `www.reviveyourhair.eu/blog/hair-loss-guide` | ‚ùå 404 |
| **ALL PAGES ARE BROKEN** | |

**Meanwhile:**

| URL | Result |
|-----|--------|
| `reviveyourhair.netlify.app/` | ‚úÖ Works |
| `reviveyourhair.netlify.app/blog` | ‚úÖ Works |
| `reviveyourhair.netlify.app/about` | ‚úÖ Works |
| **EVERYTHING WORKS ON NETLIFY SUBDOMAIN** | |

Working fine ‚Üí Started seeing 404s ‚Üí Made fixes ‚Üí Still 404s ‚Üí More fixes ‚Üí Still 404s
```

## üéØ **THE ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE: DNS, NOT CODE**

### **Why Your Code Changes Didn't Fix It:**

You were trying to fix a **DNS problem** with **code changes**. That's like trying to fix a flat tire by adjusting the steering wheel.

### **The DNS Evidence (From nslookup):**

```powershell
# Your custom domain points to:
www.reviveyourhair.eu ‚Üí 35.214.137.37 (Google Cloud IP)
reviveyourhair.eu ‚Üí 35.214.137.37 (Google Cloud IP)

# Your Netlify site is actually at:
reviveyourhair.netlify.app ‚Üí 35.157.26.135, 63.176.8.218 (Netlify IPs)
```

**THEY'RE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SERVERS!**

---

## üí° **How This Could Have "Suddenly" Happened**

### **Scenario 1: DNS Records Changed/Expired**
- Domain registrar auto-renewed domain
- DNS records got reset to default
- Old DNS configuration expired
- Nameservers changed

### **Scenario 2: Old Hosting Still Active**
- You may have previously hosted the site elsewhere (Google Cloud?)
- That old hosting is still running
- DNS still points to old server
- Old server has no files (hence 404)

### **Scenario 3: Domain Transfer/Registrar Change**
- Recently transferred domain to new registrar?
- DNS records didn't transfer
- Now pointing to parking page

### **Scenario 4: Netlify Domain Configuration**
- Custom domain was removed from Netlify
- Or never properly added
- DNS was working by accident before
- Something changed on Netlify side

### **Scenario 5: CDN/Proxy Service**
- Using Cloudflare or similar CDN?
- CDN configuration changed
- Proxy settings interfering
- Cache showing old content

---

## üî¨ **Why You Kept Getting 404s Despite "Fixing" Code**

Let me show you the timeline of your attempts:

### **What You Tried:**
1. ‚úÖ Modified `netlify.toml` redirects
2. ‚úÖ Added `force = true` flags
3. ‚úÖ Fixed `public/_redirects`
4. ‚úÖ Redeployed multiple times
5. ‚úÖ Verified files exist

### **Why Nothing Worked:**
```
YOUR BROWSER ‚Üí YOUR DOMAIN (www.reviveyourhair.eu)
              ‚Üì
         DNS LOOKUP (returns 35.214.137.37)
              ‚Üì
    GOOGLE CLOUD SERVER (wrong server!)
              ‚Üì
         404 - File Not Found

MEANWHILE:

YOUR BROWSER ‚Üí NETLIFY SUBDOMAIN (reviveyourhair.netlify.app)
              ‚Üì
         DNS LOOKUP (returns Netlify IPs)
              ‚Üì
    CORRECT NETLIFY SERVER
              ‚Üì
         ‚úÖ Files exist, redirects work!
```

**You were fixing the RIGHT SERVER (Netlify), but traffic was going to the WRONG SERVER (Google Cloud).**

## üìä **Comparison: What's Different Between Working and Broken**

| Aspect | Netlify Subdomain (Works) | Custom Domain (Broken) |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **DNS IP** | 35.157.26.135 | 35.214.137.37 |
| **Server** | Netlify | Unknown (Google Cloud?) |
| **Files** | Present | Missing |
| **Redirects** | Working | Not applicable |
| **404 Page** | Your custom 404.html | Generic Netlify parking page |

---

## üé≠ **The Illusion of "Only Blog Broken"**

You thought only the blog was broken because:

1. You were primarily testing blog URLs
2. Homepage might have had some cached content
3. You hadn't thoroughly tested all other pages
4. The 403 on apex domain vs 404 on subpages created confusion

**But in reality: ENTIRE SITE IS INACCESSIBLE via custom domain.**

---

## üîß **The Fix (For Real This Time)**

### **Step 1: Check Netlify Domain Settings**

Go to: https://app.netlify.com ‚Üí Your Site ‚Üí Domain management

**Check if these domains are listed:**
- [ ] `www.reviveyourhair.eu`
- [ ] `reviveyourhair.eu`

**If NOT listed ‚Üí ADD THEM**
**If listed ‚Üí Check for error icons or warnings**

### **Step 2: Fix DNS Records**

Go to your domain registrar (where you bought `reviveyourhair.eu`):

**Add/Update these records:**

```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: reviveyourhair.netlify.app
TTL: 3600
```

```
Type: A
Name: @ (or blank for apex)
Value: 75.2.60.5
TTL: 3600
```

```
Type: A
Name: @ (or blank for apex)
Value: 99.83.190.102
TTL: 3600
```

### **Step 3: Verify Old DNS Records**

**REMOVE any records pointing to:**
- ‚ùå `35.214.137.37` (Google Cloud)
- ‚ùå Any old server IPs
- ‚ùå Old CNAME records

### **Step 4: Wait for Propagation**

- Usually 10-30 minutes
- Can take up to 24 hours in rare cases
- Test with: https://dnschecker.org

### **Step 5: Test**

```powershell
# Should return Netlify IPs (35.157.x.x or 63.176.x.x)
nslookup www.reviveyourhair.eu

# Then test in browser
https://www.reviveyourhair.eu/
https://www.reviveyourhair.eu/blog
https://www.reviveyourhair.eu/about
```

## üìù **Questions to Answer**

To help diagnose this further, please check:

1. **When did you first notice the 404s?**
   - Exact date/time if possible

2. **Did anything change with your domain recently?**
   - Domain renewal?
   - Registrar change?
   - Nameserver change?

3. **Where did you buy `reviveyourhair.eu`?**
   - GoDaddy? Namecheap? Google Domains? Other?

4. **Are you using Cloudflare or any CDN?**
   - Orange cloud vs gray cloud?

5. **When you log into Netlify, do you see the custom domain listed?**
   - Screenshot would help

6. **Did you previously host this site somewhere else?**
   - Google Cloud Platform?
   - Different hosting provider?

---

## üéØ **Summary: Why This Seemed Mysterious**

### **What You Experienced:**
- Site working fine
- Suddenly starts showing 404s
- You fix code, redeploy, still 404s
- Netlify subdomain works, custom domain doesn't
- Seems random and inexplicable

### **What Actually Happened:**
- DNS records point to wrong server (35.214.137.37)
- That server has no files (hence 404)
- Your code changes went to correct server (Netlify)
- But traffic never reached that server
- DNS issue, not code issue

### **The Confusion:**
- You assumed "404 = broken file/redirect"
- Actually: "404 = wrong server entirely"
- Code was always fine
- DNS was always wrong
- Every "fix" updated the right server
- But traffic kept going to wrong server

---

## ‚úÖ **Action Items (Immediate)**

### **Priority 1: DNS Configuration**
1. [ ] Check Netlify domain settings
2. [ ] Check domain registrar DNS records
3. [ ] Update DNS to point to Netlify
4. [ ] Remove old DNS records

### **Priority 2: Verification**
1. [ ] Run `nslookup www.reviveyourhair.eu`
2. [ ] Check IP matches Netlify (not 35.214.137.37)
3. [ ] Test site in browser
4. [ ] Verify all pages work

### **Priority 3: Documentation**
1. [ ] Document correct DNS settings
2. [ ] Set reminders for domain renewal
3. [ ] Monitor domain configuration
4. [ ] Keep backup of DNS records

## üö® **Critical Insight**

The reason **nothing you coded fixed the issue** is because:

```
YOUR FIXES ‚Üí Netlify Server (correct files, correct redirects)
                    ‚Üì
              ‚úÖ Working perfectly
              
YOUR DOMAIN ‚Üí Google Cloud Server (no files, no redirects)
                    ‚Üì
              ‚ùå 404 errors

The traffic never reached your fixes!
```

**It's like fixing the plumbing in House A, but the address sends people to House B.**

---

## üìû **Next Steps**

1. **Check Netlify Dashboard** for domain configuration
2. **Check Domain Registrar** for DNS records
3. **Share screenshots** of both if you need help
4. **Update DNS records** as instructed above
5. **Wait 30 minutes** for propagation
6. **Test again** - everything should work

The code was never the problem. The DNS is.
