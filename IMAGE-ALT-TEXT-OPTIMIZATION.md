## 🔍 Alt Text Formula

The algorithm now generates alt text using this pattern:

```
"Hair loss transformation" 
+ [treatments if detected: finasteride, minoxidil, dutasteride, microneedling]
+ [timeframe if detected: X months, Y years]
+ "results before and after"
+ [" - " + treatments + " treatment" if treatments detected]
```

### Examples by Pattern:

**Pattern 1: Treatment + Timeframe**
```html
alt="Hair loss transformation: finasteride and minoxidil 5 month results before and after - finasteride, minoxidil treatment"
```

**Pattern 2: Timeframe Only**
```html
alt="Hair loss transformation 8 year results before and after"
```

**Pattern 3: Treatment Only**
```html
alt="Hair loss transformation: dutasteride results before and after - dutasteride treatment"
```

**Pattern 4: Generic (when no specifics detected)**
```html
alt="Hair loss transformation results before and after"
```

---

## 🤖 How It Works

### 1. Treatment Detection
The script scans the Reddit post title for:
- `fin` / `finasteride` → tags as "finasteride"
- `min` / `minoxidil` → tags as "minoxidil"  
- `dut` / `dutasteride` → tags as "dutasteride"
- `derma` / `microneedle` → tags as "microneedling"
- `keto` → tags as "ketoconazole"

### 2. Timeframe Extraction
Regex patterns extract:
- `X years` → "X year"
- `X months` → "X month"
- Example: "2.5 years" → "2 year" (rounded)

### 3. Alt Text Assembly
```javascript
function generateSEOAltText(title) {
  let altText = 'Hair loss transformation';
  
  if (treatments.length > 0) {
    altText += `: ${treatments.join(' and ')}`;
  }
  
  if (timeframe) {
    altText += ` ${timeframe}`;
  }
  
  altText += ' results before and after';
  
  if (treatments.length > 0) {
    altText += ` - ${treatments.join(', ')} treatment`;
  }
  
  return altText;
}
```

## 📈 Expected Traffic Impact

### Conservative Estimate:

**Current State:**
- 37 images with poor alt text
- Estimated Google Images traffic: ~0-10 visits/month

**After Optimization:**
- 37 images with keyword-rich alt text
- Each image can rank for 3-5 different searches
- Total ranking opportunities: ~150-200 keywords

**Projected Traffic in 3-6 Months:**
- Conservative: +500-1,000 visits/month from Google Images
- Optimistic: +1,500-2,500 visits/month
- Best case: +3,000-5,000 visits/month (if several images rank page 1)

### Why Google Images Matter:

1. **22% of all Google searches** are image searches
2. **Before and after photos** have high click-through rates (15-25%)
3. **Visual proof** converts better than text (40% higher conversion)
4. **Long-tail opportunity** - less competition than text search
5. **Mobile traffic** - images show prominently on mobile
