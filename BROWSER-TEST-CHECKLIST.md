# Browser Cache Test Checklist

## 🔍 Quick Test: Is it the browser or the deployment?

### Test 1: Hard Refresh (Clear Cache)
1. Open your live site in browser
2. Press **Ctrl + Shift + R** (Windows) or **Ctrl + F5**
3. Does it work now? 
   - ✅ YES → Browser cache issue
   - ❌ NO → Deployment issue (likely)

### Test 2: Private/Incognito Mode
1. Open a new **Incognito/Private window** (Ctrl + Shift + N)
2. Visit your live site URL
3. Does it work now?
   - ✅ YES → Browser cache/cookies issue
   - ❌ NO → Deployment issue (confirmed)

### Test 3: Different Browser
1. Open site in a completely different browser (Chrome → Firefox, or Edge)
2. Does it work?
   - ✅ YES → Your main browser has cached issues
   - ❌ NO → Deployment issue (confirmed)

### Test 4: Check Network Tab
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Refresh page
4. Look at the HTML file loaded
5. Check the response:
   - Does it have `/en/` paths? → Old files from cache
   - Does it have `../` paths? → New files loaded correctly

## 🎯 Expected Result
If **ALL tests fail**, it's NOT a browser issue - it's a deployment configuration problem.

## 🔧 The Real Issue (Most Likely)
Your **Netlify is deploying from `src/` folder** but your **multilingual site builds to `dist/` folder**.

**Solution**: Update `netlify.toml` to publish from `dist` instead of `src`.
