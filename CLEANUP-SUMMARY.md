# Clean Slate - Multi-Language Restructure

## ✅ Cleanup Complete (October 20, 2025)

The website has been reset to a clean English-only state in preparation for implementing a proper multi-language template system.

---

## 🗑️ What Was Removed:

### 1. Dutch Language Files
- **Delete:** `src/nl/over-ons.html` (Dutch About page)
- **Delete:** `src/nl/` folder (if empty)

### 2. Netlify Redirects
- **Removed:** All `/nl/*` redirect rules from `netlify.toml`
- **Kept:** English page redirects and 404 handler

### 3. i18n Configuration
- **Removed:** Dutch language configuration from `src/scripts/i18n.js`
- **Removed:** URL mappings for Dutch pages
- **Removed:** Dutch language switching logic
- **Kept:** Basic i18n structure for future template system

## 🚀 Next Steps: Implement Template System

### Phase 1: Set Up Structure
1. Create `src/templates/` folder
2. Create `src/i18n/` folder
3. Test `build-i18n.js` script (already created)

### Phase 2: Convert First Page
1. Choose simplest page (contact.html recommended)
2. Convert to template format
3. Extract translations to JSON files
4. Run build and verify output

### Phase 3: Scale Up
1. Convert remaining pages
2. Add Dutch translations back
3. Add additional languages (German, French, etc.)
4. Update `netlify.toml` build command

## 📚 Documentation Available:

- **`build-i18n.js`** - Build script for generating pages from templates
- **`TRANSLATION-GUIDE-V2.md`** - Complete guide on template system
- **`TRANSLATION-GUIDE.md`** - Original translation guide (Option 1 approach)

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

1. **Language switcher is temporarily disabled** - It will be re-enabled once template system is in place
2. **No Dutch content is live** - Clean English-only site
3. **All infrastructure is ready** - Just need to implement template conversion
4. **No data was lost** - Dutch translations can be recreated from git history if needed

---

## 🎯 Ready to Proceed

The codebase is now clean and ready for proper multi-language implementation. When you're ready to start:

1. Let me know which page to convert first (I recommend `contact.html`)
2. I'll walk you through the template conversion process
3. We'll test the build system
4. Scale to all pages

## 📝 Manual Steps Needed:

Since you're in a GitHub virtual filesystem, you'll need to manually:

1. **Delete the file:** Right-click `src/nl/over-ons.html` → Delete
2. **Delete the folder:** Right-click `src/nl/` → Delete (if empty)
3. **Commit changes:**
   - `netlify.toml` (cleaned)
   - `src/scripts/i18n.js` (simplified)
   - Deleted files

Then push to GitHub and Netlify will deploy the clean English-only site.

**Status:** ✅ Ready for fresh start with proper multi-language architecture
