## 🔍 Search Results:

Searched for: `/nl/`, `nederlands`, `dutch`, `over-ons`

**Found in:**
- ❌ `src/nl/about.html` - **PHANTOM** (grep cached result, file doesn't exist)
- ✅ Legal pages - Only mentions "Dutch law" and "Dutch tax" (contextual, not translation-related)
- ✅ Language switcher - Now says "More languages coming soon"

**No active Dutch translations found!** ✅
