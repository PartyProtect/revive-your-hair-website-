# üîç CRITICAL FINDINGS - Partial 404 Issue

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Issue:** Some pages return 404, but NOT all pages  
**Domain:** www.reviveyourhair.eu

---

## üéØ **KEY OBSERVATION: NOT ALL PAGES ARE BROKEN**

### **This Changes Everything!**

**If it were DNS issue:**
- ‚úÖ ALL pages would be broken (because DNS affects entire domain)
- ‚úÖ Would get 404 on homepage, about, store, quiz, blog - EVERYTHING

**What's Actually Happening:**
- ‚ùå Some pages broken
- ‚úÖ Some pages working
- **This pattern indicates a ROUTING/REDIRECT issue, NOT DNS!**

## üìä **Test Results by Version**

### **Current Version (22:47 - commit 369247d "robots"):**
**Multiple pages broken but not all**

| Page | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Homepage | ? | Need to test |
| /about | ? | Need to test |
| /store | ? | Need to test |
| /quiz | ? | Need to test |
| /blog | ? | Need to test |
| /blog/hair-loss-guide | ‚ùå | Known broken |

**Now testing...**

## üí° **WHAT THIS TELLS US**

### **DNS Theory is WRONG Because:**

1. **Partial Breakage**
   - DNS either works or doesn't - no middle ground
   - If DNS was wrong, ZERO pages would load
   - We're seeing selective 404s

2. **Netlify Subdomain Works**
   - `reviveyourhair.netlify.app` works perfectly
   - Same code, same server, different URL
   - If code was broken, both would fail

3. **Pattern Suggests:**
   - Redirect rules are conflicting
   - URL rewriting is inconsistent
   - Something in configuration affects certain paths

5. **20:31** - `0947edf` - Mobile layout fix
6. **20:56** - `e10223c` - **‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY & BOT PROTECTION**
7. **21:13** - `0145fe8` - **‚ö†Ô∏è ADMIN DASHBOARD**
8. **21:19** - `2150e18` - Admin dashboard security

### **Most Suspicious Commits:**

#### **1. e10223c (20:56) - "feat: implement comprehensive security and bot protection"**
- **Why Suspicious:** Security features often involve request filtering
- **Could Affect:** Headers, request handling, bot detection
- **Impact:** Might block legitimate requests if too aggressive

#### **2. 0145fe8 (21:13) - "feat: add private admin dashboard"**
- **Why Suspicious:** Adds new routing for /admin paths
- **Could Affect:** Redirect precedence, catch-all rules
- **Impact:** Might interfere with blog routing

#### **3. 369247d (22:47) - "robots"**
- **Why Suspicious:** Changes to robots.txt or sitemap
- **Could Affect:** Netlify's understanding of site structure
- **Impact:** Might affect how Netlify routes requests

## üéØ **REVISED HYPOTHESIS**

### **Old Theory (WRONG):**
```
DNS points to wrong server ‚Üí ALL pages 404
```

### **New Theory (LIKELY CORRECT):**
```
Code change introduced redirect conflict ‚Üí SOME pages 404
Probably in commits between 20:56-22:47
Most likely: security features, admin routes, or robots.txt
```

## üîç **WHAT TO CHECK NEXT**

### **After Testing 20:00 Version:**

#### **If 20:00 Version Works:**
‚úÖ **Confirms:** Issue introduced between 20:00 and current
üìç **Next Step:** Binary search through suspect commits
üéØ **Focus:** Security commit (20:56) and admin dashboard (21:13)

#### **If 20:00 Version Also Broken:**
‚úÖ **Confirms:** Issue introduced BEFORE 20:00
üìç **Next Step:** Go back to 17:56 (clean URLs commit)
üéØ **Focus:** The clean URL implementation itself

---

## üß™ **DIAGNOSTIC TESTS TO RUN**

### **On Custom Domain (www.reviveyourhair.eu):**

```bash
# Test ALL pages systematically
curl -I https://www.reviveyourhair.eu/
curl -I https://www.reviveyourhair.eu/about
curl -I https://www.reviveyourhair.eu/store
curl -I https://www.reviveyourhair.eu/quiz
curl -I https://www.reviveyourhair.eu/blog
curl -I https://www.reviveyourhair.eu/blog/hair-loss-guide
curl -I https://www.reviveyourhair.eu/blog/hair-loss-guide.html

# Check for patterns in what works vs. what doesn't
```

### **Compare Headers:**

```bash
# Working Netlify subdomain
curl -I https://reviveyourhair.netlify.app/blog/hair-loss-guide

# Broken custom domain
curl -I https://www.reviveyourhair.eu/blog/hair-loss-guide

# Compare X-NF-Request-ID, cache headers, redirect headers
```

## üìù **OBSERVATIONS TO DOCUMENT**

### **Which Pages Work vs. Broken:**

**Working Pages:**
- [ ] Homepage (/)
- [ ] About (/about)
- [ ] Store (/store)
- [ ] Quiz (/quiz)
- [ ] Blog index (/blog)

**Broken Pages:**
- [ ] Blog posts (/blog/*)
- [ ] Legal pages (/legal/*)
- [ ] Other?

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Static pages vs. dynamic routes?
- Root level vs. nested paths?
- With .html vs. without?

---

## üéØ **NEXT STEPS (PRIORITY ORDER)**

### **Step 1: Wait for 20:00 Deploy (2-3 minutes)**
- [ ] Wait for Netlify to build and deploy
- [ ] Test systematically: homepage, about, store, quiz, blog, blog/hair-loss-guide
- [ ] Document which pages work and which don't

### **Step 2: Based on Results**

**If 20:00 works:**
- [ ] Issue is in commits 20:00 ‚Üí 22:47
- [ ] Focus on security commit and admin dashboard
- [ ] Test commit by commit to find exact breaking point

**If 20:00 still broken:**
- [ ] Issue is in commits BEFORE 20:00
- [ ] Revert to 17:56 (clean URLs implementation)
- [ ] May be fundamental routing issue

### **Step 3: Isolate Exact Commit**
- [ ] Use binary search through commits
- [ ] Test each candidate
- [ ] Identify single commit that broke routing

### **Step 4: Fix Root Cause**
- [ ] Review breaking commit's changes
- [ ] Identify conflicting rule/header/security setting
- [ ] Apply targeted fix
- [ ] Keep good changes, remove problematic ones

## üö® **KEY INSIGHT**

**The fact that SOME pages work proves this is NOT a DNS issue.**

DNS is all-or-nothing:
- ‚úÖ DNS correct ‚Üí ALL pages load
- ‚ùå DNS wrong ‚Üí ZERO pages load
- ‚ùì Selective 404s ‚Üí ROUTING/CODE ISSUE

**This is a redirect configuration problem, not an infrastructure problem.**

---

## üìä **TIMELINE OF INVESTIGATION**

1. **Initial Report:** Blog page returning 404
2. **First Theory:** DNS pointing to wrong server
3. **Evidence Found:** nslookup showed different IPs
4. **Assumption:** DNS misconfiguration
5. **User Insight:** "Multiple pages broken but not all"
6. **Revelation:** Partial breakage = NOT DNS!
7. **New Direction:** Code/routing issue in recent commits
8. **Current Status:** Testing 20:00 version to narrow window

---

## ‚úÖ **ACTION ITEMS**

### **Immediate:**
- [x] Reverted to commit fb4b640 (20:00 - cookie consent)
- [x] Pushed to trigger deploy
- [ ] **WAIT 2-3 MINUTES FOR BUILD**
- [ ] Test all pages systematically
- [ ] Document working vs. broken pages

### **Once Results In:**
- [ ] Update this document with findings
- [ ] Plan next revert/test based on results
- [ ] Narrow down to exact commit
- [ ] Identify specific code change
- [ ] Apply surgical fix

---

## üéØ **PREDICTION**

Based on pattern analysis, **most likely culprit:**

**Commit e10223c (20:56) - "feat: implement comprehensive security and bot protection"**

**Why:**
- Security features often block requests unintentionally
- Timing matches when issues started
- Could interfere with Netlify routing
- May have overly aggressive bot detection
- Could conflict with CDN/proxy behavior

**Second suspect:**
- Admin dashboard routes (21:13) - could affect redirect precedence

---

**STATUS:** ‚è≥ Waiting for 20:00 version deploy to test...

**Test URL:** https://www.reviveyourhair.eu/blog/hair-loss-guide  
**Expected:** If 20:00 works, issue is between 20:00-22:47  
**If Still Broken:** Issue is before 20:00, revert further
