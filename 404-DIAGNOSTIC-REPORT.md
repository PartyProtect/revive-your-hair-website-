# 404 ERROR DIAGNOSTIC REPORT
**Generated:** October 18, 2025  
**Issue:** Production domain returns 404 for blog pages while Netlify subdomain works

---

## üîç SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGATION RESULTS

### ‚úÖ **1. FILE EXISTENCE - NO ISSUES**
- ‚úÖ File exists: `src/pages/blog/hair-loss-guide.html`
- ‚úÖ File exists: `src/pages/blog/index.html`
- ‚úÖ Deploy contains files (verified via Netlify deploy browser)

### ‚úÖ **2. NETLIFY.TOML REDIRECTS - NO ISSUES**
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/blog"
  to = "/pages/blog/index.html"
  status = 200
  force = true

[[redirects]]
  from = "/blog/:slug"
  to = "/pages/blog/:slug.html"
  status = 200
  force = true
```
- ‚úÖ Correct syntax
- ‚úÖ `force = true` set (overrides other rules)
- ‚úÖ Status 200 (rewrite, not redirect)
- ‚úÖ Order is correct (before catch-all 404)

### ‚úÖ **3. PUBLIC/_REDIRECTS - NO ISSUES**
```
/blog              /pages/blog/index.html        200
/blog/*            /pages/blog/:splat.html       200
```
- ‚úÖ Correct syntax
- ‚úÖ Properly configured

### ‚úÖ **4. SITEMAP.XML - CONTAINS PROBLEMATIC ENTRY**
```xml
<loc>https://www.reviveyourhair.eu/blog/hair-loss-guide.html</loc>
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **PROBLEM:** Sitemap points to `/blog/hair-loss-guide.html` (with .html extension)  
‚úÖ **SHOULD BE:** `/blog/hair-loss-guide` (clean URL without .html)

**Impact:** While this doesn't cause 404s, it creates confusion and may affect SEO indexing.

### ‚úÖ **5. ROBOTS.TXT - NO ISSUES**
```
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://www.reviveyourhair.eu/sitemap.xml
```
- ‚úÖ Blog not blocked
- ‚úÖ Correct sitemap reference

### ‚úÖ **6. NETLIFY SUBDOMAIN - WORKS PERFECTLY**
- ‚úÖ `https://reviveyourhair.netlify.app/blog/hair-loss-guide` ‚Üí Works
- ‚úÖ `https://reviveyourhair.netlify.app/blog` ‚Üí Works
- ‚úÖ All redirects functioning correctly

### ‚ùå **7. CUSTOM DOMAIN - CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND**
- ‚ùå `https://www.reviveyourhair.eu/blog/hair-loss-guide` ‚Üí 404
- ‚ùå `https://www.reviveyourhair.eu/about` ‚Üí 404
- ‚ùå `https://reviveyourhair.eu/` ‚Üí 403 Forbidden
- ‚ùå Returns generic Netlify 404 page (NOT our custom 404.html)

**THIS IS THE SMOKING GUN:** The domain is not pointing to this Netlify site.

---

## üéØ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

### **THE PROBLEM: DOMAIN MISCONFIGURATION**

The custom domain `www.reviveyourhair.eu` and `reviveyourhair.eu` are either:

1. **Not connected to this Netlify site at all** (DNS points elsewhere)
2. **Connected to a different/old Netlify site** (wrong site ID)
3. **DNS not fully propagated** (though unlikely after this long)
4. **CDN/Proxy layer interfering** (Cloudflare or similar)

### **Evidence:**
- ‚úÖ Netlify subdomain works perfectly (files and redirects are correct)
- ‚ùå Custom domain returns generic 404 (not our custom 404.html)
- ‚ùå Apex domain returns 403 Forbidden (wrong configuration)
- The 404 page shown on `www.reviveyourhair.eu` doesn't match our `src/pages/404.html`

---

## üîß **REQUIRED FIXES**

### **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

#### 1. **Verify Netlify Domain Settings**
Go to: Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Your Site ‚Üí Domain management

**Check:**
- Is `www.reviveyourhair.eu` listed as a custom domain?
- Is `reviveyourhair.eu` listed as a custom domain?
- What is the primary domain set to?
- Are there any SSL/HTTPS errors?
- Is the domain verified (green checkmark)?

#### 2. **Verify DNS Settings**
Your domain registrar (where you bought reviveyourhair.eu):

**For www.reviveyourhair.eu:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: reviveyourhair.netlify.app
```

**For reviveyourhair.eu (apex):**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 75.2.60.5

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 99.83.190.102
```

**OR** use Netlify DNS (easier):
- Point nameservers to Netlify's DNS servers

#### 3. **Clear CDN/Cloudflare Cache** (if applicable)
- If using Cloudflare: Purge cache, set DNS to "DNS only" (not proxied)
- If using another CDN: Disable or clear cache

#### 4. **Fix Sitemap After Domain Issues Resolved**
Change in `src/sitemap.xml`:
```xml
<!-- WRONG -->
<loc>https://www.reviveyourhair.eu/blog/hair-loss-guide.html</loc>

<!-- CORRECT -->
<loc>https://www.reviveyourhair.eu/blog/hair-loss-guide</loc>
```

Also update:
- `/about.html` ‚Üí `/about`
- `/contact.html` ‚Üí `/contact`
- `/quiz.html` ‚Üí `/quiz`
- `/store.html` ‚Üí `/store`
- All `/legal/*.html` ‚Üí `/legal/*`

## üéì **TECHNICAL EXPLANATION**

### Why Netlify subdomain works but custom domain doesn't:

1. **Netlify Subdomain** (`reviveyourhair.netlify.app`)
   - Direct connection to your Netlify site
   - Always uses latest deploy
   - No DNS issues possible

2. **Custom Domain** (`www.reviveyourhair.eu`)
   - Requires DNS records pointing to Netlify
   - Must be configured in Netlify dashboard
   - Can be affected by CDN/proxy services
   - Can point to wrong site if misconfigured

**The 403 Forbidden on apex domain** suggests DNS is pointing somewhere but not to your Netlify site. This could be:
- An old/different Netlify site
- A parked domain page
- A CDN error page
- Misconfigured DNS

---

## üìû **NEXT STEPS**

### **What to do RIGHT NOW:**

1. **Check Netlify Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://app.netlify.com
   - Find your site
   - Click "Domain management"
   - Take screenshots

2. **Check Your Domain Registrar**
   - Log into where you bought reviveyourhair.eu
   - Find DNS management
   - Take screenshots of current DNS records

3. **Share Information**
   - What DNS records are currently set?
   - Is domain listed in Netlify?
   - Are you using Cloudflare or another CDN?

### **Expected Timeline:**
- DNS changes: 1-24 hours to propagate globally
- Netlify configuration: Instant
- Cache clearing: Instant to 1 hour

## ‚úÖ **WHAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM**

These are all working correctly:
- ‚úÖ File structure (files exist in correct locations)
- ‚úÖ Netlify.toml syntax (redirects configured correctly)
- ‚úÖ _redirects file (properly formatted)
- ‚úÖ robots.txt (not blocking anything)
- ‚úÖ Build process (files are being deployed)
- ‚úÖ Redirect logic (works on Netlify subdomain)

**The ONLY problem is domain DNS/configuration.**

---

## üîç **HOW TO VERIFY DNS IS THE ISSUE**

Run these commands in PowerShell:

```powershell
# Check where www.reviveyourhair.eu points
nslookup www.reviveyourhair.eu

# Check where apex points
nslookup reviveyourhair.eu

# Should return Netlify IPs (75.2.60.5 or similar)
```

If these don't return Netlify IP addresses, DNS is not configured correctly.

## üìã **SUMMARY**

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Blog Files | ‚úÖ OK | Files exist and are deployed |
| Netlify.toml | ‚úÖ OK | Redirects configured correctly |
| _redirects | ‚úÖ OK | Proper syntax |
| robots.txt | ‚úÖ OK | Not blocking blog |
| Sitemap | ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor | Uses .html (cosmetic issue) |
| Netlify Subdomain | ‚úÖ OK | Works perfectly |
| Custom Domain | ‚ùå BROKEN | Not pointing to site |
| DNS Configuration | ‚ùå ISSUE | Needs verification |

**VERDICT:** Domain DNS configuration is the root cause. All site code and configuration is correct.
