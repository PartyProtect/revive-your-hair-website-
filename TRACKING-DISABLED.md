## How to Restore (If Needed in Future)

Since all files were deleted, you would need to:

### Option 1: Restore from Git History
```bash
# Find the commit before deletion
git log --oneline --all -- netlify/functions/tracking.js

# Restore specific files from that commit
git checkout <commit-hash> -- netlify/functions/tracking.js
git checkout <commit-hash> -- src/scripts/analytics.js
git checkout <commit-hash> -- src/admin/

# Re-add script tags to HTML files manually
# Re-add admin routes to netlify.toml manually
```

### Option 2: Start Fresh
If you need tracking in the future, consider using:
- Google Analytics 4 (already configured)
- Simple third-party analytics (Plausible, Fathom, etc.)
- Netlify Analytics (paid feature)

---

## Privacy & GDPR Compliance

### When Disabled (Current State)
- ✅ **No tracking data collected**
- ✅ **No visitor identification**
- ✅ **No session storage**
- ✅ **No API calls to tracking endpoint**
- ✅ **No cookies set** (except cookie consent preferences)

### Impact on Privacy Policy
You may want to update `src/legal/privacy-policy.html` to reflect that custom analytics are currently disabled. The privacy policy currently describes analytics data collection that is no longer happening.

## Technical Details

### How the Disable Works

#### Server-Side (Netlify Function)
```javascript
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  return {
    statusCode: 503,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      success: false,
      error: 'Analytics tracking has been disabled'
    })
  };
};
```

#### Client-Side (JavaScript)
```javascript
// Early exit - tracking is disabled
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  window.analytics = {
    trackEvent: () => {},
    trackPageView: () => {},
    trackClick: () => {},
    trackScroll: () => {},
    endSession: () => {},
    init: () => {}
  };
}
export default window.analytics;
```

## Backup Information

All tracking code was permanently deleted (not just disabled). However, you can restore files from Git history if needed in the future. The last commit before deletion can be found with:

```bash
git log --oneline --all -- netlify/functions/tracking.js
```

## Questions?

If you need to:
- Re-enable tracking
- Permanently remove tracking code
- Update privacy documentation
- Access the admin dashboard

You can restore the original functionality by following the re-enable steps above.
